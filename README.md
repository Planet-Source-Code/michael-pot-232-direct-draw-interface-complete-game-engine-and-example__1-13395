### Description

Direct Draw Interface (DDI) is a DLL that brings the speed and power of DirectX to a simple program! Note: after making full games with less than 50 lines of code, you might get a bit rusty at real programing, but until then: heres what you get (FOR FREE):

The DDI engine and Source.

The DDI Filemaker.

A Test Program.

Commented fully and ready for your enjoyment!

(it's a good idea to have Dx7VB.dll)
